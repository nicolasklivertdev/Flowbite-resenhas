                                <p>From the most used UI components like forms and navigation bars to the whole app screens designed both for desktop and mobile, this UI kit provides a solid foundation for any project.</p>
                                <span>Designing with Figma components that can be easily translated to the utility classes of Tailwind CSS is a huge timesaver!"</span>

                                <p>Flowbite has code in one place and I'm not joking when I say it took me a matter of minutes to copy the code, customise it and integrate within a Laravel + Vue application.</p>
